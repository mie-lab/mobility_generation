## Requirements and dependencies
This code has been tested on
- Python 3.11, Geopandas 0.14.4, trackintel 1.3.1, PyTorch 2.3.1, cudatoolkit 11.8, transformers 4.41.2, GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 4090

To create a virtual environment and install the required dependences please run:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mie-lab/mobility_generation
    cd mobility_generation
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate mobility_generation
    pip install -e .
    pip install -e improved-diffusion
```
in your working terminal. The **MobilityGen** implementation is built on top of the improved-diffusion package by https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion.

For projecting locations into s2grid, the s2geometry Python package needs to be build from source and available in the virtual environment. Check the installation guide in https://github.com/google/s2geometry.

## Folder structure

The respective code files are stored in seperate modules:
- `/preprocess/*`. Functions that are used for preprocessing the dataset. Should be executed before training a model. `01_project_s2.py` includes functions to project locations into s2geometery locations (require the **s2geometry** library to be installed, see `Requirements and dependencies`). `02_poi.py` includes POI preprocessing and embedding methods (**LDA**). `10_geolife.py` and `11_generate_data_geolife.py` include functions for preprocessing the raw Geolife dataset into formats that are acceptable by MobilityGen (See `Reproducing on the Geolife dataset`)
- `/diffusion/*`. Implementation of **MobilityGen** model.  
- `/config/*`. Hyperparameter settings are saved in the `.yml` files under the respective dataset folder under `config/`. For example, `/config/diff_geolife.yml` contains hyperparameter settings for the geolife dataset. 
- `/utils/*`. Helper functions that are used for model training. 
- `/evaluate/*`. Evaluation of the simulated sequences using MobilityGen. `entropy.py` includes functions to calculate the **random**, **uncorrelated** and **real entropy**. `stats.py` includes functions to calculate the mobility **motifs**.

## Reproducing on the Geolife dataset

The results in the paper are obtained from the MOBIS dataset that are not publicly available. We provide a runnable example of the pipeline on the Geolife dataset. The travel mode of the Geolife users are determined through the provided mode labels and using the trackintel function `trackintel.analysis.predict_transport_mode`. The steps to run the pipeline are as follows:

### 1. Install dependencies 
- Download the repo, install neccessary `Requirements and dependencies`.

### 2. Download Geolife 
- Download the Geolife GPS tracking dataset from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367). Unzip and copy the `Data` folder into `data/geolife/`. The file structure should look like `data/geolife/Data/000/...`.
- Create file `paths.json`, and define your working directories by writing:

```json
{
    "raw_geolife": "./data/geolife"
}
```

### 3. Preprocess the dataset
- run 
```shell
    python preprocess\10_geolife.py --epsilon 20
```
for obtaining the staypoints and location sequences for the geolife dataset. Note that the locations are directly generated from user tracking data, without the s2geometry projection. The process takes 15-30min. `loc_geolife.csv` and `sp_geolife_all.csv` will be created under `data/` folder.

- run 
```shell
    python preprocess/11_generate_data_geolife.py --src_min_days 7 --src_max_days 21 --tgt_min_days 3 
```
for obtaining the train, validation, and test staypoint sequences (source sequence and target sequences). Due to the data quality of OSM at the tracking period, we choose not to attached POIs to the locations. `train_7_3_geolife.pk`, `valid_7_3_geolife.csv`, and `test_7_3_geolife.pk` will be created under `data/` folder.

### 4. Run the MobilityGen model
- Configure the network parameters in `config/diff_geolife.yml`, and run 
```shell
    python run_diff.py --config config/diff_geolife.yml
```
for starting the training process. 
- Alternatively, specify the number of GPUs with `nproc_per_node` for training with Distributed Data Parallel:
```shell
    python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 run_diff.py --config config/diff_geolife.yml
```

The configuration of the current run, the network paramters and the log information will be stored under `run/` folder.

### 5. Simulate sequences with trained MobilityGen model
With a trained model, new sequences can be obtained with the parameters defined in `config/diff_sample_geolife.yml`. In the config file, specify the path and name of the trained model, and run 
```shell
    python run_diff_sample.py --config config/diff_sample_geolife.yml
```
for starting the simulation process. Simulated traces will be stored json format under `run/` folder.
